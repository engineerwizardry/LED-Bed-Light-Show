# LED-Bed-Light-Show
The Desk Light Show is the blinking of LEDs that are placed on two sides on a desk. An Arduino Uno is wired to the LEDs to control the blinking. The LEDs will blink in a certain pattern but after a certain time (Usually about 1 second) the LEDs will blink in a different pattern. Each pattern will be unique.
