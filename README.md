# LED-Bed-Light-Show
The LED Bed Light Show will contain 8 LEDs on two sides of a bed. A switch would be used to control the operation of the project. In addition, a pushbutton will be used. When a pushbutton is pressed the first time, the LEDs will light up and perform a specific pattern (e.g. Specific LEDs turn on or get brighter and other LEDs remain off.) If the pushbutton is pressed a second time, then a different pattern with the lighting of the LEDs would be displayed. This process will repeated until the pusbutton is pressed on the tenth time. After the tenth time, the pattern will turn back to the very first pattern.
