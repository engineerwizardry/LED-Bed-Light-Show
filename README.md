# LED-Bed-Light-Show
The LED Bed Light Show will contain 8 LEDs on two sides of a bed. The 16 LEDs in total will perform 5 patterns of lighting. Each pattern is unique and it will make the bedroom like an actual light show. The best part is that you can experience it in your bed! Two shift registers will be used to control the lighting and the "brain" of this operation is an Arduino Uno. Long strands of wires will be used to connect the LEDs and the Arduino Uno will be placed on the shelf that is directly adjacent to the bed.
